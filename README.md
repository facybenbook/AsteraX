This is my version of the first project Unity's certification course on Coursera

** It is currently a work in progress **

Please be responsible and only use this for learning/comparison purposes, eg. Don't submit it to Coursera as your own work :S. All supporting models/assets are copyright to the Coursera/Unity course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/core-interaction-programming). All C# scripts are my own (outside of standard assets, DebugExtensions, etc) and you're welcome to use them however you wish.
